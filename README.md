<img src="https://github.com/ndrake127/sfml-automata-2d/blob/master/resources/demo.gif" width="50%">

A 2D cellular automaton simulator displayed using SFML with parallelism. Currently using Conway's Game of Life rules.

Depends on SFML and tclap, which can be automatically installed using the included installdeps.sh file. This likely needs to be run as root.
